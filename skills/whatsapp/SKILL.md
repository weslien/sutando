# WhatsApp (wacli)

Send messages, list chats, and search history using [wacli](https://github.com/steipete/wacli) — a local CLI that syncs a WhatsApp Web session into `~/.wacli/`. No third-party service, no API key; the auth flow is a QR-code scan from the user's phone.

## When to use

- The user asks to send a WhatsApp message, list chats, or search WhatsApp history.
- The user asks "did X message me on WhatsApp?" or similar history-search questions.
- **Not** available until `wacli auth` has completed on this Mac. Probe with `wacli chats list --limit 1`; if it errors "not authenticated," tell the user to run `wacli auth` (QR-code pairing from their phone).

## Install + auth

```bash
brew install steipete/tap/wacli       # one-time install
wacli auth                            # opens a QR for the user to scan from WhatsApp → Linked Devices
```

The session lives at `~/.wacli/`. Stays signed in across reboots until the user revokes the linked device from their phone.

Optional `.env` settings (label shown in WhatsApp's Linked Devices screen):

```bash
WACLI_DEVICE_LABEL=Sutando
WACLI_DEVICE_PLATFORM=CHROME
```

## Commands

```bash
wacli send text --to "+14155551234" --message "Hello!"     # send
wacli send text --to "+14155551234" --message "$(cat draft.txt)"  # multi-line via stdin / file
wacli chats list --limit 20                                # recent chats
wacli messages search "keyword" --limit 10                 # search history
wacli messages list --chat "+14155551234" --limit 20       # read a thread
```

Phone numbers are in E.164 (`+countrycode...`). For groups, pass the JID returned by `wacli chats list` instead of a phone number.

## Conventions

- **Always confirm message content with the user before sending.** Matches the iMessage / SMS / X-post pattern in CLAUDE.md.
- For multi-line / long messages, write to a `/tmp/wa-*.txt` and pass via `--message "$(cat /tmp/wa-X.txt)"` — avoids shell-escape issues with quotes and emoji.
- WhatsApp delivers messages best-effort; `wacli send text` returning success means the message hit WhatsApp's servers, not that the recipient has read it.

## Failure modes

- `wacli: not authenticated` → user must run `wacli auth` (QR-code flow). One-time per Mac.
- `wacli: linked device revoked` → user revoked the session from their phone. Re-run `wacli auth`.
- `wacli: rate limited` → WhatsApp is throttling. Back off ~30s and retry.
- Phone-number invalid → confirm the user provided E.164 format with a `+` prefix.

## Origin

Synthesizes the proposal in [PR #180](https://github.com/sonichi/sutando/pull/180) by @priyansh4320 (stale + conflicts, never landed) and the wacli reference already documented in CLAUDE.md's "Built-in capabilities" section. Issue #179 (asking for WhatsApp support) was closed 2026-05-16 noting the capability had landed as inline doc.
