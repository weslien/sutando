Sutando health check — verifies all components are running correctly.

Usage:
  python3 src/health-check.py                  # full check, human-readable
  python3 src/health-check.py --json           # machine-readable output
  python3 src/health-check.py --fix            # attempt to fix issues
  python3 src/health-check.py --emit-task      # write tasks/task-health-*.txt on failure
  python3 src/health-check.py --notify-on-fail # macOS notification on failure

Checks:
  - Voice agent (port 9900), web client, agent API, dashboard
  - Critical files (CLAUDE.md, build_log.md, ACTIVITY.md)
  - Memory system (MEMORY.md index, key memory files)
  - Notes directory
