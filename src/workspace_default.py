"""Canonical workspace-directory resolution for Sutando services.

All runtime artifacts (tasks/, results/, state/, data/, build_log.md, ...) live
under the workspace dir. Components MUST consult `SUTANDO_WORKSPACE` first;
when unset, fall back to `~/.sutando/workspace/` — a hidden, OS-neutral home-
relative path that stays out of Sutando.app's `~/Library/Application Support/
sutando/` (which owns Chromium-style cache: Cache/, GPUCache/, Cookies/,
blob_storage/, etc.).

Historic anti-pattern: bridges fell back to `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent`
which resolved to the repo root, polluting `git status` with runtime artifacts
on bare-shell launches that forgot to set the env. Worse, when invoked from an
app-bundled `src/` symlink, it walked into the bundle and stranded owner DMs
(tasks landed in bundle-tasks/ while the watcher polled workspace-tasks/).

def _migrate_inrepo_notes(workspace: Path) -> bool:
    """One-time migration of `<repo>/notes/*` -> `<workspace>/notes/` when env-set
    workspaces have stragglers in the in-repo location.

    Different trigger than `_migrate_from_legacy`: that one fires only when
    `$SUTANDO_WORKSPACE` is UNSET (legacy install upgrading to the new default).
    THIS one fires when the env IS set, BUT the in-repo `notes/` dir (which
    code used to write to before the workspace contract) still contains files
    that aren't under `<workspace>/notes/`. The trigger condition is
    "workspace and in-repo location are different, AND in-repo has notes."

    Scope: top-level `.md`/`.txt` files only. Subdirectories (e.g.
    `notes/projects/`, `notes/media/`) are intentionally NOT migrated —
    workspace notes are flat by current convention. If/when nested notes
    become supported, this migrator grows a `recursive=True` flag rather
    than silently changing posture. Owner's notes layout (2026-05-16) is
    flat; this matches.

    Symmetric to `_migrate_from_legacy`'s posture: non-destructive on collision
    (skip the file if it already exists at the workspace location), logs each
    moved file to stderr, idempotent (second run finds in-repo empty and
    bails). Also writes a sentinel (`<workspace>/.notes-migrated`) after a
    successful run so subsequent `resolve_workspace()` calls short-circuit
    on the cheap stat-check rather than re-running iterdir; per Lucy's #769
    review obs 2.

    Per owner directive 2026-05-16: every design change must ship with an
    automatic migration script so existing users don't have to migrate
    manually. This is the migration for the notes-location change.

    Returns True iff at least one file was migrated.
