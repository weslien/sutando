Behavioral tests for telegram-bridge's TOFU + tri-state load_allowed().

Closes #811. The TOFU bug-fix in PR #808 rests on a load-bearing tri-state
distinction in load_allowed():

  - None        → access.json doesn't exist → TOFU-eligible
  - set()       → file malformed (fail-closed) OR explicitly empty allowFrom → never TOFU
  - set([ids])  → normal allow check

Without these tests, a future refactor could silently collapse None → set()
and the bridge would regress to the silent-drop bug. Each test pins one
acceptance-criterion case from #811:

  (a) Missing access.json → tofu_onboard() writes the file with sender as
      tofuOwner, message accepted.
  (b) Malformed JSON → load_allowed() returns set() (fail-closed), no TOFU.
  (c) Empty allowFrom: [] → load_allowed() returns set() (admin lockdown),
      no TOFU.
  (d) Pre-existing populated allowFrom → normal allow check works.
  (e) Race-safety: ACCESS_FILE.exists() returning True between
      None-detection and tofu_onboard() write does NOT clobber.
  (f) Tri-state pin: load_allowed() returns the exactly three documented
      types for missing / malformed / valid file.

Plus one chmod test that pins the security fix from #810 (chmod 0o600 on
TOFU-written access.json).

Run: python3 tests/telegram-bridge-tofu.test.py
Exit code: 0 on pass, 1 on fail.
